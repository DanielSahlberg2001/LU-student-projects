Disclaimer: ALL my code was run within the LUNARC HPC Desktop with access to both an ldmx container image and a Jupyter lab container image. I have no idea how the code reacts outside of HPC Desktop. Additionally, no simulation data files or accompanying sub-directories are provided, you will have to create your own work environment and tweak the names of files and directories to your liking.
